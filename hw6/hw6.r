#Method 1:
#This algorithm exploits the fact that interarrival times are exponentially distributed. 
#We simulate the arrival times until the maximum time horizon is achieved.

lambdaExp = 2
t=10
n=100
T = c(rep(0, n)) # inter-arrival time - exponential distributed
for (i in c(1:n)){
    T[i] = rexp(1, rate = lambdaExp) #sample for exponential dist
}
plot(c(1:n), T)

#any arrival process can also be specified by two alternative stochastic processes.
#The first alternative is the sequence of interarrival times S_n
S = c(rep(0, n)) # arrival times - gamma distributed
S[1] = T[1]
for (i in c(2:n)){
    S[i]= S[i-1] + T[i]
}
plot(c(1:n), S)

#2nd alternative - an arrival process is the counting process X(t)
X = c(rep(0,t)) # number of arrivals up to time t - poisson process distributed (lambda*t)
for (i in c(1:t)){
    for (j in c(1:t)) {
        if ( S[i] < j ) {
            X[j] = X[j] + 1
        }
    }
}
plot(c(1:t), X)

#Method 2
#This method simulates the number of jumps by Possion random variable 
#with the rate equals to the product of the time horizon and the processâ€™s rate. 
#Then, to calculate arrival times, random variables with uniform distribution 
#are generated and ordered after
