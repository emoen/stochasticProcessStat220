#Method 1:
#This algorithm exploits the fact that interarrival times are exponentially distributed. 
#We simulate the arrival times until the maximum time horizon is achieved.

#Method 2
#This method simulates the number of jumps by Possion random variable 
#with the rate equals to the product of the time horizon and the processâ€™s rate. 
#Then, to calculate arrival times, random variables with uniform distribution 
#are generated and ordered after
